## Hi! I'm Muil Yang ‚ú®

### Introduction

I'm a software engineer skilled in JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, C/C++, Next.js/React.js, Node.js, Django, Flask, and AWS services. I'm currently pursuing a Master‚Äôs in Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas.

With 3.5 years of experience as a software engineer, I developed applications using Next.js, Node.js, Docker, and libraries like Recoil and TanStack Query. These roles sharpened my ability to quickly learn new technologies and meet deadlines while collaborating across teams.

Through hackathons, personal projects, and AWS certification, I‚Äôve deepened my focus on deployment with Docker and AWS. I've also gained experience with LLM APIs and models, crafting effective prompts.

These experiences have allowed me to hone my skills in both frontend and backend development. I am eager to apply this knowledge and continue growing in the field, contributing my expertise to future projects.
